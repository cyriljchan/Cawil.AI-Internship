For the image output functionality, download the image dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/kvpratama/pokemon-images-dataset/

or if you have your own dataset, make sure that the image names are formatted as follows:
1.jpg, 2.jpg, 3.jpg, ... etc.

this is because the program finds the images through the Pokemon number
